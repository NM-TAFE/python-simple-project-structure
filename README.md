# python-simple-project-structure

Template for a simple Python project structure.

This template contains an `app/` folder for the actual Python application and a `test/` folder for any unit tests that
should be part of the project.

## Folder structure

```
+ python-simple-project-structure/
    + app/
        + .keep
    + test/
        + __init__.py
    + .gitignore
    + README.md
```

You can create a new repository using this template by clicking 'Use this template': 

![Use this template button in GitHub](https://github.com/NM-TAFE/python-simple-project-structure/blob/master/images/01-github-use-template.png)

After clicking this button, GitHub will indicate that you're creating a new repository with the same files and folders as the original:

![Start repo with same files and folders](https://github.com/NM-TAFE/python-simple-project-structure/blob/master/images/02-github-same-files-and-folders.png)

Give your new repository a name (mandatory) and an optional description. Here, you can also choose whether you want the repository to be private or public and whether or not to include all branches:

After creating the new repository, GitHub will show a message indicating the original template repository:

![Repository generated from original](https://github.com/NM-TAFE/python-simple-project-structure/blob/master/images/04-generated-from-message.png)

## Important
